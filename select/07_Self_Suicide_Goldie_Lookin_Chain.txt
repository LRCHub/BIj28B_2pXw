They think you're crazy.
They think you're mad.
They call you stupid, worthless, tell you you're not worth it.

And now you're walkin' back to a place you call home,
But you feel so alone.

The same hurtful hits, it's your darker place.
In your virgin ears, the remarks they make.

And if they, if they really knew all of those things.
That you do in your room to hide the pain
I bet their minds would change.
I'll bet their minds would change.

They'd change if they knew the pain.
Change

'Cause I believe in these scars
'Cause I believe.
