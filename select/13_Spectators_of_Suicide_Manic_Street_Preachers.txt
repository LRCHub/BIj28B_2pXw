So the concept is this, basically
We're gonna walk on this nation
We're gonna walk on this racist power structure
And we're going to say to the whole damn government
"Stick 'em up, motherfucker, this is a hold up
We come for what's ours"

Obedience to the law is free desire
Under curfew from sharp neon barbed wire
Wasting away this country, wearing like born dead
Free heroin shots for those who will no longer beg

Spectators of suicide
Exploding in society's eye
Spitting glass from our mouths
Dying like yesterday

The only free choice is the refusal to pay
Life reduced to suicidal comforting
Cigarette death, it's suckling
Choked on the same lines that we've all said

Spectators of suicide
It's wounding society's eyes
Speak facts from my mouth
Died like yesterday

You're gonna shoot us dead with the words we say
You're gonna shoot us dead with the words we say
You're gonna shoot us dead with the words we say
You're gonna shoot us dead with the words we say
