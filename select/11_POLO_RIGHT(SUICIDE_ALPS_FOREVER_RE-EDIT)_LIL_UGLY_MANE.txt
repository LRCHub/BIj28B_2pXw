Got my, got my polo right, just got my fade did

Watch me stang these hizzoes, I ain't playing games
'Bout to let the whole clip dump on these suckas mane
I got the p-p-pain for all them so-so lames
If they interrogating, Ugly Mane ain't saying names
Ain't no snitch in my squad, ain't no bitch in my blood
Ain't slangin' nothing but hard, ain't bustin' nothing but slugs
Ain't no snitch in my squad, ain't no bitch in my blood
Ain't slangin' nothing but hard, ain't bustin' nothing but slugs
Catch me creepin' through the cut to the other side
I'm rippin' them up and buzzin' and poppin',
Them sucka ass bitches got nowhere to hide
It's that pimp Ugly Mane, you know what it is
You know what it is
Got my, got my polo right, just got my fade did
I'm on that snow white, that's why I'm faded
Got my, got my polo right, just got my fade did

Got my, got my polo right, just got my fade did
I'm on that snow white, that's why I'm faded
Boy I'm blowing kush out the window screaming 'Fuck you!'
Speedin' right past you, playas like me is straight cashews
Get a grip, fuck that, I lost my mind
So if the sun goes down I know it's 'bout that time
This dumb ho acting like he hard to find
I got his main bitch strapped, I'mma give her the sign
And let 'em squeeze on that perpetrator
Hurt will leave his vertebrae reverberating
Cursed him, he deserved his fate
Murder in the worst way, should of kept quiet in the first place
Stab him in the brain 'til the blade break,
Watch his nerves Harlem Shake
One shot, all it takes
I'mma turn his head the wrong way until the collar break
Got my, got my polo right, just got my fade did
I'm on that snow white, that's why I'm faded
Got my, got my polo right, just got my fade did
I'm on that snow white, that's why I'm faded
Got my, got my polo right, just got my fade did
I'm on that snow white, that's why I'm faded
Got my, got my polo right, just got my fade did
I'm on that snow white, that's why I'm faded
