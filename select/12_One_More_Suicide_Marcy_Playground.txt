Christopher O'Malley
Went out on a bridge
Down in Chehalis
And clutching his bible
And a letter from her
Fell into the river
Pity no one was there
No angels in the air
And the morning paper ran
One more suicide
His mama stayed by
The river side
Down in Chehalis
And clutching her bible
And a letter from him
Fell into crying
Pity no one was there
No angels in the air
And the morning paper ran
One more suicide
Pity no one was there
No angels in the air
And the morning paper ran
One more suicide
One more suicide
One more suicide
