The sky is falling always pulling
It is strange how people always seem
To fall in love
And now that we are in the dark
It keeps crawling as it tells to make love
The ones we love
Because dead
Because dead
Because dead
Showed no one luck

Blossom on the shaving cream
And I run to the side of the hut
Come to the eyes we see for we
Have dropped our luck at the silent bushes
Because the dead
Because the dead
Because the dead showed no one luck
Because the dead
Because the dead
Because the dead showed no one warmth

Feel the warmth of the spring gleam
As it gently washes over
Butterflies fly to the room and change
A crawling spider follows outside
And bleakly out into the sun
Crawls away and torn away
Because the dead
Because the dead
Because the dead showed no one luck
Because the dead
Because the dead
Because the dead showed no one warmth
